* TODOs

- Optimize unidecode-chars.el, probably the same way, as in Python Unidecode
- In unidecode-unidecode function i can also use (map 'string ...) instead of (apply #'concat (mapcar ...)), but i'm not sure how to require cl-extra.el

* How this package was made

The following is the explanation of the process of converting the
Python package to Emacs Lisp.

The following Python script was run in Unidecode's source directory to
load its data to =final_data= list.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import os, sys

xs = os.listdir('.')
xs.remove('__init__.py')
xs.sort()

final_data = []
for filename in xs:
    module = __import__(filename[:-3])
    module_data = list(module.data)

    # some modules have data of 255 entries, fill them up to 256
    if len(module_data) < 256:
        module_data += [''] * (256 - len(module_data))

    final_data.extend(module_data)
#+END_SRC

The following script was used to dump =final_data= to a JSON file.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import json

with open('unidecode.json', 'w') as filename:
    json.dump(final_data, filename)
#+END_SRC

The following command was used to load JSON data as Emacs Lisp vector,
after installing =json= package in Emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(json-read-file "unidecode.json")
#+END_SRC

After that the resulting vector was just stored verbatim in
=unidecode-chars.el=.
